# CodingChallengeOIT
Coding challenge for BYU OIT developers

This tic tac toe game functions directly in the terminal and was written in python.

For the alotted time that I was given to complete this challenge I spent the first hour and a half writing the main logic and functions of the game. The next 30 minutes were spent handling potential errors caused by the user. 
Unfortunately I ran into a couple bugs that I had to dedicate some time towards debugging along the way. 
I then used StackOverflow to learn how to use the 'colorama' library to color the inputs within the terminal. 
The remainder of my time was spent organizing the code, cleaning it, and adding comments for clarity. 

I enjoyed this challenge! Thank you for considering me for the position!
